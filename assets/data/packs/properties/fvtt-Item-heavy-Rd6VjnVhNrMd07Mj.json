Any character trying to use a Heavy weapon with only one hand, or while mounted on a horse or chariot, takes a -2D penalty for all Actions using the weapon. A warrior wielding a Heavy weapon can&rsquo;t use a shield unless they use the weapon one-handed. A Heavy weapon easily knocks aside parrying weapons and light shields. It ignores 1 point of Parry or Shield defence.</p>"
