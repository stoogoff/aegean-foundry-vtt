# Aegean RPG system for FoundryVTT

`Alpha version`

The Aegean RPG system for Foundry VTT including sheets for the following:

- Aegean PC Character Sheet
- Adversary Sheet (minions, champions, and legends)
- Advantages / Disadvantages
- Armour
- Attacks (for creatures and monstrous adversaries)
- Careers
- Deities
- Equipment
- Equipment Properties
- Talents
- Weapons

Almost all parts of a character can be created ready for play, including adding equipment, relationships to the Gods, as well as talents, specialisations and advantages / disadvantages.

Systems are in place to roll skill checks by selecting a characteristic and skill and automatically calculating successes. Risk can be tracked, vulnerable state is taken into account when making skill checks and Wounds are automatically rolled and added to the character (although penalties aren't automatically applied). Damage can be applied which takes into account the character's armour. Combat options are provided on the sheet so players can roll for Defend, or Misdirect actions etc.

Elements of the polis can be tracked, including:

- Buildings
- Retainers

## TODO

The following sheets and items still need to be created:

- Factions
