# Aegean RPG system for FoundryVTT

`Alpha version`

The Aegean RPG system for Foundry VTT including sheets for the following:

- Aegean PC Character Sheet
- Advantages / Disadvantages
- Armour
- Deities
- Equipment
- Equipment Properties
- Talents
- Weapons

Almost all parts of a character can be created ready for play, including adding equipment, relationships to the Gods, as well as talents, specialisations and advantages / disadvantages. The major missing thing for a PC are careers but as they don't directly affect play at the table that should be OK.

Systems are in place to roll skill checks by selecting a characteristic and skill and automatically calculating successes. Risk can be tracked, vulnerable state is taken into account when making skill checks and Wounds are automatically rolled and added to the character (although penalties aren't automatically applied). Damage can be applied which takes into account the character's armour.

## TODO

The following sheets and items still need to be created:

- Careers
- Factions
- Mystery Cults
- Adversary Sheet
- City Sheet
- Arkhons
- Buildings
- Retainers

### Things Coming Soon

Additional roll types, including Standing rolls, recovery rolls, as well as adding options for skill specialisations to the check. Favour and Disfavour need to be added as options to roll results, when relevant.

Wound effects need to be applied automatically, as well as providing combat options on the PC sheet.

Combat tracker to manage initiative as well as combat status effects, such as prone or stunned.

PC Relationships with NPCs.
